- [ ] Failed login attempt monitoring
- [ ] Rate limit violation alerts
- [ ] Suspicious activity detection
- [ ] Incident response plan documented

### Environment & Deployment
- [ ] Production environment variables secured
- [ ] No secrets committed to git
- [ ] .gitignore configured correctly
- [ ] Vercel environment variables set
- [ ] Database backups configured (hourly + daily)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Quick Start: Enable Security Now

### 1. Test Current Security Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Run security test script
npm run test:security

# Or manually:
./scripts/test-security.sh
```

### 2. Apply RLS Policies (10 minutes)

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/enable_rls_policies.sql`
3. Execute the SQL
4. Verify with:
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables
   WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   ```

### 3. Secure Storage Bucket (5 minutes)

1. Supabase Dashboard → Storage → member-documents
2. Configuration:
   - Public bucket: OFF
   - File size limit: 10MB
   - Allowed MIME types: application/pdf, image/jpeg, image/png
3. Apply policies from `supabase/migrations/storage_policies.sql`

### 4. Deploy to Production (15 minutes)

```bash
# Build and test locally
npm run build
npm run start

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Verify security headers
curl -I https://bosun.ae
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification (10 minutes)

- [ ] Test login as member
- [ ] Test login as admin
- [ ] Verify member can only see their own data
- [ ] Verify admin can see all data
- [ ] Test file upload
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works
- [ ] Check security headers present
