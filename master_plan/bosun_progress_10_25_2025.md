<artifact identifier="bosun-progress-update" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="markdown" title="Updated Bosun Development Progress">
# Bosun Development Progress - Updated October 25, 2025

**Project Start Date**: October 2025  
**Target MVP Launch (Revenue)**: Week 4 (on track)  
**Target Full Platform**: Week 8  
**Last Updated**: October 25, 2025

**Business Model**: Bitcoin settlement rails (80%+ cost savings) with hidden multilateral netting for margin optimization  
**Pricing Strategy**: Pure transaction fee model, NO monthly platform fees. Simple: 0.8% (Year 1), 0.6% (Year 2), 0.4% (Year 3+). Hidden volume discounts implemented from start.  
**Market Size**: $655B global TAM ($395B freight, $130B oil/tankers, $130B bunkers); targeting $200B MENA initially  
**Target Year 1**: 40 members, $9B gross volume, $72M revenue, $70.1M profit (97% margin)  
**Settlement**: Once daily initially (5 PM Dubai), expand to twice daily in Week 6  
**CRITICAL**: Netting is proprietary trade secret - show "network efficiency" without explaining methodology

## Knowledge Base & Learnings

### Technical Learnings:
1. **RLS Complexity**: Supabase RLS can be challenging - disable for MVP, enable for production
2. **Storage Policies**: Easier to use public buckets initially, secure later
3. **Circuit Breakers Essential**: Don't process real money without safety limits
4. **Simulation Mode Critical**: Always preview before executing financial operations
5. **Audit Logging**: Log everything from Day 1, invaluable for debugging
6. **Admin Controls**: Manual override capability essential for safe operations

### Business Learnings:
1. **Pricing Simplicity**: Pure transaction fee (no monthly fee) reduces friction
2. **Value Prop Clarity**: "80% cost savings" resonates immediately
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show value without revealing methodology
4. **Member Onboarding**: Automated registration much better than manual SQL
5. **Document Upload**: Members expect to upload documents, not email them

### Process Improvements:
1. **API-First Development**: Test backend logic before building UI
2. **Incremental Features**: Build MVP features first, enhance later
3. **AI-Assisted Coding**: Massive productivity boost with Claude/Cursor
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Emoji-based console logs help debugging
5. **Safety First**: Circuit breakers and simulation prevent disasters

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Active Issues:
1. **RLS Disabled**: Workaround in place, must fix before production
2. **Public Storage**: Temporary solution, needs proper policies
3. **No Email Notifications**: Manual communication required for now
4. **No Monitoring Alerts**: Check admin dashboard manually

### Resolved Issues:
1. ✅ Member creation failing → Fixed duplicate email constraint
2. ✅ Storage upload errors → Made bucket public
3. ✅ Transaction form validation → Added client-side checks
4. ✅ Settlement API 403 errors → Fixed admin role check
5. ✅ Missing database tables → Created all required tables
