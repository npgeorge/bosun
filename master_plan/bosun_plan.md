# Bosun Implementation Plan (Optimized)

## Development Timeline: 4 Weeks to MVP, 8 Weeks to Full Platform

This plan outlines a streamlined approach to building the Bosun platform, leveraging AI development tools (Cursor, GPT-4, v0.dev) for rapid iteration with a focus on proving core value proposition quickly.

**Core Strategy**: Lead with Bitcoin rails value proposition (80%+ cost savings vs SWIFT), use multilateral netting as hidden operational optimization to maximize margins.

**Pricing Strategy**: Pure transaction fee model with no monthly platform fees - removes friction, aligns with maritime industry norms, accelerates adoption. Simple time-based pricing: 0.8% (Year 1), 0.6% (Year 2), 0.4% (Year 3+). Volume discounts hidden but implemented from start.

**Market Size**: $655B global TAM ($395B freight, $130B oil/tankers, $130B bunkers); targeting $200B MENA region initially.

**Target**: Year 1: 40 members, $9B volume, $72M revenue, $70.1M profit (97% margin).

**Key Optimization**: 4-week critical path to first revenue, then polish to 8 weeks for full platform stability.

// Test these manually with Postman before any UI
const API_ENDPOINTS = {
  // Settlement operations
  '/api/settlements/simulate': 'POST',      // Test without executing
  '/api/settlements/preview': 'GET',        // What would happen now?
  '/api/settlements/execute': 'POST',       // Run real settlement
  
  // Admin operations
  '/api/admin/override': 'POST',            // Manual intervention
  '/api/admin/margin-analysis': 'GET',      // Real-time P&L
  '/api/admin/health': 'GET',               // System health check
  
  // Member operations
  '/api/transactions': 'POST',              // Submit transaction
  '/api/transactions/:id': 'GET',           // View transaction
  '/api/member/balance': 'GET',             // Current position
  
  // Monitoring
